            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Chandigarh is a city, district and union territory in India that serves as the capital of the two neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana. The city is unique as it is not a part of either of the two states but is governed directly by the Union Government, which administers all such territories in the country.</p>

            <p>Chandigarh is bordered by the state of Punjab to the north, the west and the south, and by the state of Haryana to the east. It is considered to be a part of the Chandigarh Capital Region or Greater Chandigarh, which includes Chandigarh, and the city of Panchkula (in Haryana) and cities of Kharar, Kurali, Mohali, Zirakpur (in Punjab). It is also known as a Tricity which includes Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali. It is located 260 km (162 miles) north of New Delhi and 229 km (143 miles) southeast of Amritsar.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Chandigarh was the dream city of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. After the partition of India in 1947, the former British province of Punjab was divided into two provinces, East Punjab in India (mostly Sikhs and Hindus) and West Punjab in Pakistan (mostly Muslims).[23] The Indian Punjab required a new capital because the former capital, Lahore, had become part of Pakistan after the partition.[24][25] In 1949 the American planner and architect Albert Mayer was tasked to design a new city to be called "Chandigarh". The government carved out Chandigarh from about fifty Puadhi-speaking villages in the then-state of East Punjab, India.[26] Shimla was the temporary capital of East Punjab until Chandigarh was completed in 1960.</p>

It covers an area of approximately 114 km2.[25] It borders the states of Haryana and Punjab. The exact geographic coordinates of Chandigarh are 30.74°N 76.79°E.[32] It has an average elevation of 321 metres (1053 ft).

            The city, lying in the northern plains, includes a vast area of flat, fertile land.

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>Chandigarh has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) characterized by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall and great variation in temperature (−1 °C to 46 °C OR 30.2 °F to 114 °F). The average annual rainfall is 1110.7 mm.[34] The city also receives occasional winter rains from the Western Disturbance originating over the Mediterranean Sea.

            The western disturbances usually bring rain predominantly from mid-December till the end of April which can be heavier sometimes with strong winds and hails if the weather turns colder (during March–April months) which usually proves disastrous to the crops. Cold winds usually tend to come from the north near Shimla, capital of Himachal Pradesh and from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, both of which receive their share of snowfall during wintertime.</p>
